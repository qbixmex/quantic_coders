# Understanding the Basic Data Types in JavaScript

JavaScript, one of the most popular programming languages, has several fundamental data types that every developer should understand.

These data types are essential for building robust applications and managing data effectively. Let's dive into the basic data types in JavaScript.

## Primitive Data Types

Primitive data types are the simplest types of data and are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed.

### Number

Represents both integers and floating-point numbers.

```javascript
let year = 2022;

console.log(year);

// output -> 2022

const price = 12.75;

console.log(price);

// output -> 12.75
```

### String

Represents a sequence of characters.

```javascript
let title = "James Web discover life in a new new planet";

console.log(title);

// output -> James Web discover life in a new new planet
```

### Boolean

Represents a logical entity and can have two values: true or false.

```javascript
let isEnabled = true;

console.log(isEnabled);

// output -> true
```

### Undefined

Is a data type where the value is undefined but the variable is assigned.

You can assign explicitly undefined but unnecessary because javascript can assign undefined explicitly.

```javascript
// Explicit
let title = undefined;

console.log(title);

// Implicit
let age;

console.log(age);

// output -> undefined
```

### Null

Represents the intentional absence of any object value.

```javascript
let address = null;
```

### Symbol

Introduced in ES6, represents a unique and immutable identifier.

It is commonly used as key in an object.

```javascript
const PRICE = Symbol('price');

const object = {
  [PRICE]: 14.25,
};

console.log(object[PRICE]);

// output -> 14.25
```

### BigInt

Introduced in ES2020, represents integers with arbitrary precision.

```javascript

let bigInt = 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n;

console.log(bigInt);

// output -> 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n
```

Non-Primitive Data Types

These types are objects and can store collections of data and more complex entities.

### Object

An unordered collection of key-value pairs.

```javascript

const person = {
  name: "Stan Lee",
  age: 75
};

console.log(person.name);
console.log(person["age"]);

// -- output --
// Stan Lee
// 75
```

### Array

A special type of object that holds an ordered list of values.

```javascript

const numbers = [1, 2, 3];

console.log(numbers);

// output -> [ 1, 2, 3 ]
```

### Function

A special type of object that can be invoked.

```javascript
function greeting(name) {
  console.log("Hello" + " " + name);
}

greeting("Daniel");

// output -> Hello Daniel
```

### Date

Represents dates and times.

```javascript
const date = new Date();

console.log(date);

// output example -> 2024-07-14T14:02:25.324Z 
```
